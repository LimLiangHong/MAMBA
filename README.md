Interactive Design - Assignment 1 Portfolio Website by Lim Liang Hong

<h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>

<p>This is a portfolio website that displays my works and abilities as an aspiring 3D game artist.</p>

<h2 id="designProcess">Design Process</h2>
<h4>users</h4>

users of the website are instantly greeted with a simplistic and clean user interface. They can use either the navigaion bar at the side to navigate through the website. If the user decides to scroll instead, they can find
some navigation cards that will lead the user to the different web pages. So some interactivity with the ui and the user as the ui helps with the navigation of the website.


<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
These are the current features and pages of my website

<h2 id="existingFeat">Existing Features</h2>

Introduction Page. Allows users to get to know a little about me.

Navigation bar on the right. Allows user to navigate to the different pages.

they will come across the navigation cards where they can also use to navigate through the websites.

2D page. Allows users to view my 2d works and abilities in 2d art.

3D page. Allows users to view my 3d works and capabilities in 3d art.
